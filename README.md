# Embedded-Slideshow
A Python 2.7 script written to run on a Raspberry Pi Zero connected to a departmental LCD screen. The idea is that the script runs on startup using cron, copies image files from connected USB drives and runs a slide show of those images using feh. Currently, the file copier is in an 'additive' state, so that it continues to add unique images to the folder parsed by feh, but it is simple to adjust to remove all images each time new images are copied (useful in the case of message board images that will become out of date).

Maybe other people can try to get this working with crontab, but all my attempts ended with failure (cron only seems to run code in the background, so feh would not appear onscreen, although all the USB transfer stuff would still run). The current method of running this automatically on startup on a Raspberry pi zero is to edit the file ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart to execute slideloader.py once the desktop environment is set up.
